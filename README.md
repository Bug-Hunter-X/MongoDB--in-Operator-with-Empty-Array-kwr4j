# MongoDB $in Operator with Empty Array

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error related to MongoDB's `$in` operator when used with an empty array.  The issue lies in the unexpected behavior of an empty `$in` query: it returns an empty result set, rather than returning all documents.  This behavior can be counterintuitive and lead to subtle bugs in applications that aren't explicitly handling the case of empty input arrays.

## Bug Description
The provided `bug.js` demonstrates incorrect usage of the `$in` operator with an empty array. The expected behavior might be to return all documents, but instead, it returns an empty result set. This can be problematic in scenarios where the array being used for filtering might sometimes be empty (e.g., when there are no filter criteria). 

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` provides a solution to handle cases where the array might be empty. Instead of directly using the empty array, the solution checks for the empty array and modifies the query accordingly. If the array is empty, the query is modified to return all documents.  This ensures consistent behavior regardless of the input array's state.
